- Writing a program
- cargo = Rust's package manager and build system
- curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
- rustc --version
- echo $PATH
- rustup update
- rustup doc


- rust-analyzer vs code extension
- a directory to store your Rust code
- touch hello_world.rs
- to compile the file = rustc hello_world.rs
- After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.
- ./hello_world
- println! calls a Rust macro
- Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.
